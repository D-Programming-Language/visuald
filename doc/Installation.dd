Ddoc

$(P The click-through-installer will guide you through the installation process. The installer lets you select the
Visual Studio Version for which you want Visual D to be installed. It will always install
for all users, not only for a single user.)

$(P To compile your application, you must have $(LINK2 http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html, DMD),
$(LINK2 https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC, GDC) or $(LINK2 https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc, LDC)
installed. Not all functionality 
has been thoroughly tested with GDC and LDC, so having DMD available for cross-checking is recommended.

$(P Visual D does $(B not) work with any of the $(B Express) versions of Visual Studio. Other than the 
commercial editions, the Express versions do not support loading third party extensions and add-ins.)

$(P A $(B free) alternative are the integrated $(B Visual Studio Shell) distributions, that can be downloaded
here: ($(LINK2 http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=40646580-97FA-4698-B65F-620D4B4B1ED7&displaylang=en, VS Shell 2008),
$(LINK2 http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8e5aa7b6-8436-43f0-b778-00c3bca733d3&displaylang=en, VS Shell 2010)) and 
VS Shell 2012 (see below for links). The shells are identical with the Visual Studio IDE, but stripped of any language support. It
still contains the native debugger that can be used to debug D applications.)

$(P For debugging applications, you should also install cv2pdb which is now included in the
Visual D installer. Please make sure, changes to Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat do
not mix with previous manual installations of $(LINK2 http://svn.dsource.org/projects/cv2pdb, cv2pdb). 
Visual D also installs the alternative debug engine mago that does not need cv2pdb.)

$(P Unfortunately, the Visual Studio Shells 2008 and 2010 are missing one file that is needed for 
the conversion of the debug information by cv2pdb. This is $(B msobj80.dll) for VS2008 and $(B msobj100.dll) for VS2010 
and must be extracted from a standard installation, the Visual C Express edition or the Windows SDK. 
You might also find it installed by other Microsoft products.
Put this file alongside mspdbcore.dll, normally in $(LESS)VS-installation-path$(GREATER)\Common7\IDE.)

$(P The Visual Studio Shell 2012 is installed with two packages, the 
$(LINK2 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40752, isolated shell) followed by the 
$(LINK2 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30663, integrated package). Fortunately it
has all the files needed for debugging, and the Visual D installer patches the installation to 
make the x64 debugger work.)

$(P The Visual Studio Shell 2013 is installed similar to VS Shell 2012, the 
$(LINK2 http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/F/E/BFE2AA75-B6E4-493D-B564-70086B3EAD4A/vs_isoshell.exe, isolated shell) and the 
$(LINK2 http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9832180, integrated package).)

$(H2 Using GDC)

$(P To use GDC as the compiler to build D files, you will first have to install the MinGW environment and the GDC compiler:)
$(UL
  $(LI MinGW64 installer: $(LINK http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/))
  $(LI GDC binaries: $(LINK https://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc/downloads))
)

$(P Add the MinGW64/bin path to your PATH environment variable or the executable path list in the "GDC Directories" 
option page. Then switch the "Compiler" option in the project configuration to "GDC".)

$(P To create a 64-bit executable, you will have to add a new platform to the project and solution 
in the configuration manager.)

$(P Known issues:)
$(UL
  $(LI when building a library you should change the output file name extension to ".a".)
  $(LI when building a library object files will be generated into the project directory, not the 
    intermediate directory, because there seems to be no GDC option to change the output folder for multiple files.)
)

$(H3 Debugging)

$(P cv2pdb has been extended to also convert from DWARF debug information to PDB, so it 
is possible to debug applications built with GDC in Visual Studio. Be sure to select
the "Visual Studio" debugger in the debugger project settings. Mago cannot be used 
as the debug engine, it currently only supports the DMD CodeView debug format.)
